	\begin{abstract}
        Structural instability is traditionally seen as a failure mode to be avoided. However, in recent years multiple novel designs which exploit the rapid, large scale deformations seen in nonlinear structures have been developed. A development of this design approach is the investigation of using interacting instabilities, a well known and studied phenomena, for useful functionality in deployment of morphing structures. In this work we seek to demonstrate the feasibility of the exploitation of interacting, sequential instability to achieve functionality for a wing mounted control surface for the application of gust load alleviation. This builds on a novel concept for a passively actuated spoiler first proposed by Wheatcroft et al. in \cite{Wheatcroft_2023}. To display feasibility, a bespoke experimental setup was designed to initiate sequential instability between a clamped-clamped Euler strut and a composite laminate shaped to the profile of a NACA 3412 aerofoil. Results from experimentation imply that a sequential instability was successful in achieving rapid deployment. The results are compared to models of the test setup produced in Abaqus, to assure validity of the experiment and models produced. The captured data also provides insight into the behaviour of a deployment system that exploits sequential instability which should be of use for further development of the presented concept.

	\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Control Surfaces for Gust Load Alleviation}
		Gust loads are well known as a source of potential catastrophic failure in aircraft structures; with rare, extreme gusts in particular being a source of the maximum loads that an aircraft may experience. \cite{Wu2019,Guo_2015}. Aircraft structural requirements are driven by extreme cases to prevent failure, despite operating in far less intense loading environments for the majority of the aircraft's service life \cite{Li2021}. The added capability to cope with extreme gust loads is unnecessary most of the time and comes with an associated parasitic mass increase, which causes reduced fuel efficiency of the aircraft. 
		
		Gust load alleviation (GLA) systems aim to reduce the effect of gust loads while minimising mass increase by altering the aerodynamic profile of the wing \cite{Li_2022}. Active control surfaces such as ailerons, spoilers have been used to achieve this \cite{Li_2022}. However, such control surfaces utilise conventional, active actuation mechanisms such as hydraulic or electro-mechanical actuators \cite{QI_2011}. These mechanisms still introduce significant mass and complexity to aircraft which still results in a decrease to fuel efficiency and an increase in cost and manufacture time. A passively actuated GLA system is a mechanism which is able to deploy using the deformation of the wing itself. These are attractive as they are typically simpler and require no external energy \cite{Li_2022}. A lightweight, passive GLA system could provide the necessary gust alleviation whilst keeping the parasitic mass added to the aircraft low.  
		
		\subsection{Sequential Instabilities}
		A potential actuation mechanism for a passive GLA system is through the utilisation of structural instabilities. The traditional view on structural instability, known as '\textit{Buckliphobia}', is largely negative and the presence of buckling is seen as a failure mode. '\textit{Buckliphillia}' is an emerging design philosophy which seeks to exploit instability as a design feature \cite{Reis_2015}. By deliberately designing a structure to become unstable in predictable ways, useful functionality can be achieved, such as large and rapid deflections in shape morphing structures. This approach has potential application for aircraft design as the deflections necessary for actuating a control surface could be achieved through a '\textit{Buckliphillic}' approach. Examples of structural instability exploited for functionality in control surface actuation include: A bistable composite trailing edge flap \cite{Daynes2010} and a non-linear spring wing-tip device for gust load alleviation \cite{Castrichini2017}.

        While functionality using single structural instabilities has been achieved, as seen in the aforementioned designs, the different types of instability are not all suitable for every application and there are positives and negatives to each. For example, super-critical bifurcations offer minimal deflections pre-buckling, useful behaviour for structures to remain stowed, but its stable post buckling response limits its ability to achieve rapid and large deflections \cite{Wheatcroft_2023}. By extending this approach to include the exploitation of interacting instabilities, new interesting and novel designs for dynamic structures can be produced. Buckling modes are able to interact with each other and interacting instabilities occur when two or more buckling modes share coincident critical points \cite{Wheatcroft_2023}. Whilst the adoption of structural instability as a design feature has received much attention in recent years and shifted the view of instability to be more positive, interacting instabilities are still viewed primarily as a failure mechanism. Use of sequential instabilities could allow for multiple instability types to be exploited within a single strucutre, enabling refined control over the device deployment. A pair of instabilities can be considered sequential when an instability in one system triggers a subsequent instability in another. A novel concept for a passively-actuated spoiler proposed by Wheatcroft et al. exploits sequential, interacting instabilities to produce a large post buckling deflection in a bistable, constant curvature, composite laminate \cite{Wheatcroft_2023}. This concept design could allow for alleviation of wing loads under gust, whilst eliminating the need for heavy, active deployment mechanisms.
		
		\subsection{Pop-up Spoiler Concept}

			\label{fig:OGConcept}
		\end{figure}
	
		The original novel spoiler concept proposed by Wheatcroft et al. is shown in \cref{fig:OGConcept} and is constituted from an Euler strut and a bistable composite laminate. In the original work the laminate is a constant curvature. For this investigation, the concept is extended to include a composite laminate shaped to the upper surface of an aerofoil to better resemble the application for a wing mounted spoiler. It is envisioned that strain caused by deflection in a wing under heavy load will cause the strut to buckle into a mode that subsequently causes the laminate to buckle, creating a sequential instability. A representative bar and spring diagram for this system is shown in \cref{fig:BarNSpring}. From this diagram the deployment mechanism which exploits the  interaction between the a pair of instabilities can clearly be seen. This should produce the ideal behaviour, shown in \cref{fig:DesiredPath}, where the deflection of the laminate, $u_{out}$, is plotted as a function of the enforced axial compressive deformation of the Euler strut, $u_{in}$. Initially $u_{out}$ grows slowly as $u_{in}$ increases. Once $u_{in}$  reaches a critical value, it results in the system traversing an unstable region, resulting in a dynamic deflection and a large, rapid increase to $u_{out}$.

	  \subsection{Research Objectives}
        The primary objective of the present work was to develop a method to experimentally demonstrate sequential instability to display the feasibility of the passively actuated spoiler concept proposed by Wheatcroft et al. in \cite{Wheatcroft_2023}. The secondary objective was to characterise the relationship between the response of the system and the properties of both the Euler strut and laminate.

    \subsection{Laminate}
    \subsubsection{Cutting}
    To mitigate dust generation SE-84LV laminate was cut with a water-lubricated wet diamond tile cutter by RUBI. To mitigate the risk of chipping the thin ply was cut with stainless steel Glass Fibre Shears by Wilkinson.
    \subsection{Test Rig}
    \subsubsection{MDF Aerofoil}
    Limitation in the availability of workshops r(intrro).

    \end{figure}
    Thirty sections illustrated in~\Cref{fig:laser} were cut out of \SI{10}{\milli \meter} thick MDF using Trotec SP 500. Sections were later glued using PVA-based glue. After curing for 24 hours the part  was sanded with an oscillatory sander from Makita using 80-grid sandpaper. Pilot holes for brass inserts were drilled out and the tool surface was painted black. Brass inserts from AIEX were placed in pre-drilled holes and were hammered down.
    \subsubsection{Boundary Conditions}
    Tabs illustrated in~\cref{fig:nipple} were laser cut form \SI{6}{\milli \meter} cast acrylic using Trotec SP 500, they were used to apply pin support to the test laminate in a point corresponding to point C in \cref{fig:OGConcept}. Two holes spaced \SI{200}{\milli \meter} apart have been drilled into a mild steel bar 15x5x270\SI{}{\milli \meter} using Axminster trade at325PD pillar drill. Bar was wrapped with black electrical tape to avoid reflection and was used to clamp the composite leading edge to the aerofoil.

    \section{Numerical Modelling}
    ABAQUS was used for the finite element analysis of the strut-spoiler system. The Euler strut was modelled with beam elements and the spoiler used composite shell elements, as seen in \cref{fig:ModelAssem}. The spoiler was designed to follow the profile of the NACA 3412 aerofoil. 
    A tie constraint was applied at the centre of the strut and at the centre of the equivalent quarter-chord position of the spoiler (point A in \cref{fig:ModelAssem}). A mesh sensitivity study, outlined in \cref{fig:MeshSens} was also performed. Following from \cite{Wheatcroft_2023}, the spoiler is clamped at the leading edge and the nodes at point B are constrained to only move in the XZ plane. Additionally, the Euler Strut has clamped-clamped edge constraints. 

        \begin{figure}[!h]

        \caption{ The variation in the post-buckling response, of the Thinply laminate, for varying numbers of elements meshed to the spoiler. 2010 elements was found to be an adequate compromise between accuracy and run time. As the Euler strut is relatively simpler, a mesh sensitivity study was thought to be unnecessary, and a total of 140 beam elements were used.}

    The Euler strut was modelled as steel ($E$ = \SI{200}{GPa}, $\nu$ = \SI{0.3}{}) and the spoiler was modelled as one of two laminates.  The properties of the two laminates are shown in \cref{tab:ModelProp}.
    %\\
    
    In order to model the non-linear, post buckling behaviour and to map the system's equilibrium paths, a Riks step was used. A compressive displacement of \SI{1}{\milli\meter} was prescribed to both ends of the column in this step. The first buckling event is the Euler buckling of the Euler strut. At the point of buckling, the column reaches a pitchfork bifurcation. In order to bring the response down the desired equilibrium path (buckling in the positive $y$ direction, into the spoiler), an imperfection was seeded into the model. The imperfection took the form of a \SI{2.5}{\newton} force acting in the positive $y$ direction at point A. This force was assigned to the model before the Riks step, to ensure the force stays constant during the analysis. Naturally, any imperfection would impact the response. For example, \cref{fig:Imperfect}, displays the difference in results when a \SI{5}{\newton} and \SI{10}{\newton} force is used instead of the \SI{2.5}{\newton} force. The tip displacement at zero axial beam displacement is higher for the two former cases. This results in a lower axial beam displacement for any given vertical trailing edge displacement, meaning that the spoiler would snap through at a lower applied displacement. The chosen \SI{2.5}{\newton} force seeds a \SI{0.10}{\milli\meter} vertical displacement to the centre of the beam, \SI{0.014}{\percent} of the total length of the beam. For the experimental beam, the imperfections would likely be larger than this and they are also likely to vary greatly. To simplify the comparison between the numerical and experimental results, a beam with minimal imperfections was modelled, so a nudge force of \SI{2.5}{\newton} was used. 

    The signs of the eigenvalues for the tangent stiffness matrix were used to determine the stability of the system. ABAQUS indicates if at least one of the eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness matrix is negative, in each analysis increment. If all the eigenvalues are positive, the system is stable. However, if at least one is negative, the system is unstable.

    The SE 84LV/ HEC laminate has extension-twist coupling. Therefore, the spoiler made from this laminate would experience thermal warping, when it cools after cure. This thermal warping was incorporated into the model for using the SE 84LV/ HEC laminate. Generic coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) values were assigned to the laminate ($1\cdot10^{-6}K^{-1}$ and $3.5\cdot10^{-5}K^{-1}$, for the CTE parallel and perpendicular to the fibre direction, respectively). To minimise warping, a low temperature was chosen for the cure dwell time, of 80\;$^\circ C$. Therefore, a temperature field of -60\;$^\circ C$ was applied to the model to allow the analysis of the risk to be carried out on the warped laminate. However, the North Thinply 402/ T1000 laminate has no extension-twist coupling, so there was no temperature field applied in its analysis.

        % I'd put "testing" insted of "ramping" -Jacopo
        % I'd put the recording speed with the led power -Jacopo
    
        The recording speed for the high speed camera was selected at 2000 frames per second. This was chosen to account for a 10.9 second buffer, allowing the full test from the application of the force to the retraction plate to be completed and captured. The ramping methods were chosen via trial and error, where a trial plate was loaded and unloaded via various displacement rates until the entire test was able to be completed within the buffer time, while achieving the plate deployment. It should be noted that, after the deployment, the crosshead returned to its initial position at the default return speed of the Shimadzu testing machine, which could not be changed.
    
        The ramping method applied to the Shimadzu for the SE84 plate was as follows:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Ramp at $0.25\;\text{mm/sec}$ up to $0.5\;\text{mm}$;
                \item Hold for $0.1\;\text{sec}$;
                \item Ramp at $0.5\;\text{mm/min}$ up to $2300\;\text{N}$;
                \item Return to initial position.
            \end{enumerate}
    
        The ramping method applied to the Shimadzu for the T1000 plate was as follows:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Ramp at $0.25\;\text{mm/sec}$ up to $0.23\;\text{mm}$;
                \item Hold for $0.1\;\text{sec}$;
                \item Ramp at $0.5\;\text{mm/min}$ up to $930\;\text{N}$;
                \item Return to initial position.
            \end{enumerate}
    
        The LED's were positioned to face the plate and a power of $15\%$ was imposed for a homogeneous illumination entire composite plate, and to avoid glare and reflections which potentially could invalidate the DIC results. %plate? shell?
	
    \section{Results}
    
        \subsection{Numerical Results}
        $u_{in}$ vs $u_{out}$ graphs which show the displacement response of the system produced in the FE models for both SE84 and Thinply are shown in \cref{fig:TPUinUout} and Figure XX. These plots are related to the ideal behaviour of the system which is shown in \cref{fig:DesiredPath}. For both materials the response follows the desired behaviour, with an initial small increase to $u_{out}$ until $u_{in}$ reaches a critical value. After $u_{in}$ reaches the critical value there is a rapid increase to $u_{out}$
               
        Eigenvalue analysis of the models was used to determine the stability of the model at each step. A negative eignvalue indicates that the model is unstable. The unstable regions are denoted in \cref{fig:TPUinUout} and Figure XX.
